## 1. Recommended track definition template

The below is track definition template to use in general, unless the user doesn't define or request different structure.

Note: [length: 180] is a generic length (3 minutes), suitable for most situations with v3.5 and v4.0.

- no more than 200 characters long for models v4.0 and earlier
- no more than 1000 characters long for models v4.5 and above
