## 1. Recommended track definition template

The below is track definition template to use in general, unless the user doesn't define or request different structure.

Note: [length: 180] is a generic length (3 minutes), suitable for most situations with v3.5 and v4.0.

[length: 360] is a good standard for v4.5 large-scale pieces, uch as ambient instrumentals.

For actual songs the length should be set to lesser values to avoid provoking engine to duplicate verses.

For v4.5 and higher, try the following factors first: audio 45% (if any), style 50%, weirdness 55%. Drop weirdness below 4% if the AI produces too chaotic an output.

#### Style of Music

As required by definition, provide typically 2 versions:

- For versions prior to v4.5: 200 or less characters long
- 1000 or less characters long for models v4.5 and above

## 3. Vocal + Noisy beats fusions

Typically, highly rich and hallucinogenic results.

A. Vocal traditions to sample as “source DNA”
- **Isicathamiya / Mbube (SA Zulu male choirs).** Tight, soft-footed a cappella stacks popularized by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Great for call-and-response hooks and bass drones.
- **Georgian polyphony (3-part, regional variants).** Rugged, clustered chords that sit beautifully against sub-bass.
- **Bulgarian women’s diaphony.** Bright, dissonant, “open-throat” harmonies—instant otherworldly color.
- **Sardinian “cantu a tenore”.** Four-man circle singing with guttural bass/contra parts—perfect for low drone layers.
- **Corsican “paghjella”.** Three fixed entries (segonda→bassu→terza); echo-rich, a cappella textures.
- **Inuit throat singing (katajjaq).** Duo, antiphonal, percussive breaths—works as rhythmic top-line.
- **Tuvan throat singing (khöömei/kargyraa).** Overtone whistles and subharmonic growls—thick spectral beds.
- **Sacred Harp / shape-note.** Loud, communal four-part “hollow square”—raw, driven block chords. 
- **Gregorian/plainchant.** Monophonic, modal, unaccompanied—clean lines that survive heavy processing. 
- **Kulning (Nordic herding calls).** High-piercing, ornamented shouts that cut through dense mixes. 
- **Qawwali (Sufi).** Lead + chorus, claps, harmonium/tabla—ecstatic build architecture for drops. 

B. Grit/engine genres to “carry” or stress the vocal source
- **Phonk / drift phonk.** Memphis rap sampling, chopped/screwed; drift phonk adds cowbell + fast swing. 
- **UK Drill.** Sliding 808s, triplet snare science, dark pads. 
- **Grime (≈140 BPM).** Jagged, syncopated breakbeats; MC-forward, but works instrumental. 
- **Footwork/Juke (≈160 BPM).** Chopped vox, rapid syncopation—great for “vocal as percussion.” 
- **Gqom.** Minimal, dark broken-beat house from Durban; hypnotic club churn. 
- **Amapiano.** Log-drum bass hooks + mellow keys; can host choirs elegantly. 
- **Industrial / Noise / Breakcore / Gabber.** From metallic rhythm and harsh textures to 160–220 BPM break mayhem and distorted kicks—maximal stress tests for choral timbres.

### 2. Iron Ridge Polyphony

Georgian Polyphony × UK Drill

Note: 50% of vocal hallucinations in v4.5

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Three-part Georgian male polyphony over sliding-808 UK drill: stacked close intervals, pedal-tone bass, sparse bells, cold pads, triplet hats; tape haze; ghost phrases teased, no literal lyrics; 140 BPM.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
Austere UK drill framework fused with rugged three-part Georgian polyphony. Sliding 808 sub anchors a pedal-tone bass while close-interval male harmonies form clustered, heroic blocks. Drums emphasize triplet hat science, woodblock/perc flickers, and low-swing snares at 140 BPM. Pads stay wintry and distant; a few bell stings cue drops. Tape wow/flutter and light granular bloom introduce spectral smearing to encourage soft “unknown-language” vocal emergence without explicit lyrics. Arrangement favors call/answer chords, sustained pedal tones, and clipped motif cues that Suno can reassemble into chant-like hooks. No rap verse needed—voice is “choir-as-lead.”

### 3. Serrated Dawn at 140

Bulgarian Diaphony × Grime (140)

Hallucinogenic: rich vocal hallucinations in 25% (v4.5, weirdness 55% or higher)
Chaotic noise composition at weirdness over 55% in v4.5, on brink of cacophony.

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Bright Bulgarian women’s diaphony over 140 grime: jagged syncopation, square-lead stabs, sub pulses; sharp clustered chords cut through metallic rooms; granular tails invite ghost syllables.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A 140 BPM grime chassis—syncopated kicks/snares, minimal square-lead stabs, and pulsing sub—supports brilliant, dissonant Bulgarian women’s diaphony. Clustered/open-throat harmonies slice through a metallic, plate-reverb environment. Sparse motifs repeat as short cells so Suno can reassemble them into non-lexical “hallucinated” refrains. Granular echoes trail off into shimmer to seed phantom syllables. The drop trades harmonic stabs for a pure choral wall, then returns with tight hats and a gliding sub. Keep the mix forward, bright, and slightly sibilant for spectral edge; no explicit language—voice functions as percussive harmony.

### 4. Tenore Over Durban

Sardinian Tenore × Gqom

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Sardinian tenore quartet (bassu/contra/mesu/oche) over minimal Durban gqom: broken kick grids, air horns, log-drum hints; guttural drones mirror sub; ritual call-and-circle energy; ~125 BPM.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
Minimalist gqom propulsion—broken kick patterns, stark claps, and cavernous spaces—supports a Sardinian “cantu a tenore” circle: bassu/contra gutturals as living sub, mesu as mid drone, oche as bright lead. BPM ~125 keeps it hypnotic. Short antiphonal cells present the tenore like rhythm instruments; occasional log-drum-styled hits mirror bassu shapes. The arrangement alternates dry, intimate circle-room moments with club-scale call-and-response drops. Air-horns/sweeps are sparse. Light tape dirt and room-impulse reamping help Suno bloom non-lexical choir behaviors. Voice remains lyrical-free, percussive, and ritual.

### 5. Stone Chapel Footwork

Corsican Paghjella × Footwork

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Three-voice Corsican paghjella (segonda→bassu→terza) chopped into 160 BPM footwork grids; vocal hits as percussion, sub flickers, clap grids, vinyl haze; non-lexical refrains, sharp room bloom.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
Austere footwork chassis at 160 BPM—rapid syncopation, clap grids, micro-kicks—carries Corsican paghjella’s three-voice entry order (segonda, bassu, terza). Short antiphonal phrases are sliced into percussive vox hits; bassu doubles the sub as a call, segonda lays center tone, terza gives bright ornaments. Sparse organ/pad stabs sketch tonality while vinyl/tape haze and short plate reverbs bloom tails to encourage ghost-syllables. No literal lyrics—voices function as rhythmic/harmonic figures. Drops alternate between dry a-cappella cells and hyper-chopped vocal percussion, then resolve into a hovering drone coda.

### 5a. Stone Chapel Footwork for Kamaskera Kamadan

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Paghjella trio chopped into 160 footwork; bassu mirrors sub, terza ornaments snap to grid; cowbell ghosts, tape haze, hand-drum blips nod to Kamaskera’s ritual phonk; non-lexical, bright/kinetic.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A 160 BPM footwork lattice—rapid clap grids, micro-kicks, sub flickers—reframed for Kamaskera Kamadan. Corsican paghjella’s entry order (segonda→bassu→terza) is performed as short antiphonal cells, sliced into percussive vocal hits. Bassu doubles the sub as a living drone; segonda anchors the center; terza adds bright ornaments that snap to the step grid. To preserve Kamaskera’s “Urban Zulu / ritual phonk” ancestry without leaving footwork, we thread in cowbell ghost ticks, dusty tape flutter, and low hand-drum blips during drops. Metallic plate tails and brief granular blooms seed soft ghost-syllables (no literal text). The arrangement pivots between dry a-cappella cells, hyper-chopped vocal percussion, and a hovering drone coda that hints at circle-chant energy—hallucination-friendly but club-functional.

- Use **vinyl/tape haze + short plates** for spectral smear; avoid long halls (keeps it tight for 160).  
- For higher hallucination rates, A/B an alt take adding **female ghost pads** quietly under terza in the [ritual-break].

### 5b. Stone Chapel Footwork — Persona Seed

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Paghjella trio as percussive hits over 160 footwork; tight stone-chapel IRs, close mics, cowbell ghosts, hand-drum blips; bassu=sub drone, terza ornaments; dusty tape flutter; non-lexical, kinetic/ritual.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
Persona-oriented capture of Corsican paghjella fused with 160 BPM footwork. Three-voice entry (segonda→bassu→terza) is performed as short antiphonal cells, then micro-sliced into grid-snapped vocal percussion. Bassu doubles the sub to imprint a living drone; segonda centers the mode; terza supplies bright ornamental snaps. To preserve Kamaskera’s ritual lineage without leaving footwork, faint cowbell ghosts and low hand-drum blips sit beneath the lattice, plus light tape flutter. Room modeling uses **tight stone/brick chapel IRs** (early reflections emphasized, fast decay) so Suno learns close, dry timbre first. Metallic plate tails are trimmed; granular blooms are subtle—just enough to seed soft, non-lexical ghost syllables. No words; voice acts as rhythm/harmony. Arrangement alternates dry a-cappella cells, hyper-chopped drops, and a concise drone coda.

#### Persona-seeding notes (do first render exactly once):

- Cowbell/hand-drum layers at **−18 to −24 LUFS relative** to main vox grid—present but subliminal.  
- If you need more “Kamaskera scent,” add **female ghost pads** at −22 LUFS only in [ritual-break].  
- Save this render as **Parental/Seed**; subsequent Persona builds can widen rooms and raise weirdness.

### 6. Frostbite Amen Duel

Inuit Katajjaq × Breakcore

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Percussive Inuit katajjaq duet (inhaled/exhaled bursts) over 180–196 BPM breakcore: Amen edits, whiplash fills, bitcrush, granular tails; breath games drive the groove; zero lexical text.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A feral breakcore engine (180–196 BPM) with Amen/Think edits, switch-ups, and gated subs is steered by Inuit katajjaq’s antiphonal breathing games. Short inhale/exhale motifs become rhythmic triggers; stutters, reverse grains, and comb-filter sweeps splinter phrases into phantom syllables. The arrangement alternates tumble-run barrages with “vacuum drops” where only breath percussion remains. Light distortion and bitcrush grit the top; transient shaping keeps throat pops articulate. No words—just pulse, rasp, and call-response. Coda freezes on time-stretched breath into glacial shimmer.

### 7. Iron Overtone Foundry

Tuvan Khöömei/Kargyraa × Industrial

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Subharmonic kargyraa + overtone whistles over machine-room industrial: heavy kicks, anvil hits, piston rhythms, turbine drones; re-amped hall tails; ritual tempo 96–104; wordless, tectonic.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A slow-grinding industrial ritual (≈100 BPM) forged from piston rhythms, metallic anvil hits, and turbine drones. Tuvan throat singing layers—kargyraa (subharmonic growl) underpinning khöömei/sygyt overtones—form the lead bed. Re-amped impulse responses (warehouse/ship hull) give iron bloom; side-chain swells pull drones around the kick. Sparse distortion and granular smear seed low-register ghost phonemes without explicit text. Mid sections open to pure drone/overtones before slamming back into machine cadence. Final minute lets overtone whistles ride a receding factory rumble.

### 8. Hollow Square Slide

Sacred Harp (Shape-Note) × Drill

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Shape-note four-part shouts over UK drill: sliding 808s, triplet hats, dark pads; block-chord “hollow square” refrains as chorus stabs; tape haze; non-lexical calls (no worship text), 140 BPM.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A lean UK drill frame (140 BPM) with sliding 808 sub, triplet hat science, and low-swing snares under a Shape-Note “hollow square” choir. Four-part block chords hit like brass stabs; occasional call-and-response swells create chorus-style hooks without words. Keep vowels broad (“ah/oh”) for percussive clarity; let bass lead lines shadow the tonic like a congregational pedal. Pads stay dusky; short plate/room tails encourage faint ghost-syllables. No explicit religious text—this is interval color and crowd power only. Drops thin to sub + handclap before the choir slams back in stacked unisons.

### 9. Cowbell Cloister (Slow Phonk Chant)

Gregorian Plainchant × Phonk (slowed)

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Monophonic chant phrases over slowed phonk: cowbell ticks, chopped vox chops, woozy tape, dusty keys; sub-swells, gated room; melismas glide through haze; non-lexical (no Latin text), ~96 BPM.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A slowed-phonk engine (~96 BPM): cowbell ghosts, wood-block echoes, warped tape, and chopped-n-screwed micro-edits. Over it, plainchant-style single-line melodies drift in free-time arcs, printed with close, dry timbre then smeared by gentle wow/flutter and short room. The chant remains lyric-free—pure vowels and melismas—so Suno can hallucinate soft pseudo-syllables at phrase tails. Sub-bass moves in swells rather than slides; dusty electric-piano stabs sketch modal centers. Drops remove drums entirely, leaving tape hiss, cowbell memory, and chant over sub air. It feels devotional yet street-worn.

### 10. Ridge Echo Lattice (160)

Kulning Calls × Footwork/Juke

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
High-piercing kulning herding calls sliced into 160 footwork/juke syncopation; call-and-answer riffs, sub flickers, clap grids; short alpine room; non-lexical, agile and bright.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
Footwork/juke at 160 BPM with rapid clap grids, micro-kicks, and agile sub bursts. Kulning—aerial Nordic calls with ornaments and glides—becomes the lead instrument: short calls are sampled into grid-snapped riffs and echo-answers. Keep the room tight (alpine early reflections, fast decay) so pitch bends read cleanly; add brief granular blooms at phrase ends to seed ghost syllables. Occasional triangle or wood chime accents hint at open air. The “loop-shift” reframes call shapes into downward spirals before a final bright reprise. No words—just calls as melody/percussion.

### 11. Dervish on the Durban Floor

Qawwali Chorus × Gqom

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Lead qawwal + response chorus over minimalist gqom: broken kick grid, cavern claps, harmonium bed, tabla one-shots; ecstatic swells, long handclap arcs; non-lexical refrains; ~123 BPM.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A sparse gqom chassis (~123 BPM) of broken kicks, cavern claps, and sub air hosts a Qawwali-style layout: lead voice rides a harmonium drone while a small chorus answers in short ecstatic cells. Handclaps stretch into long arcs that cue rises and drops. Tabla one-shots punctuate turnarounds; log-drum hints mirror the drone. Keep text non-lexical (pure vowels + syllabic taans) so Suno can bloom phantom syllables. Use short warehouse IRs for impact, reserving longer plate only on peak swells. The drop strips to drone+claps+lead melisma before the chorus slams back in stacked refrains.

### 12. Glass Choir in Feedback

Bulgarian Diaphony × Noise

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Bright Bulgarian women’s diaphony sustained into noise-ambient: feedback beds, bowed metal, granular fog, tape howl; clustered chords bloom, dissolve, reappear; wordless, glacial and fierce.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
Dissonant/open-throat Bulgarian diaphony is stretched into a noise-ambient sculpture. Sustained cluster chords hang over feedback beds, bowed-metal scrapes, and low tape howl. Granular smearing lets vowel edges shed phantom syllables. Dynamics move from near-silence to burnished glare, then into ash-quietness. No drums—only pressure and release. Short impulses (coin-hits, wire twangs) mark section pivots; distortion rides are restrained to preserve overtone ladders. Absolutely non-lexical; the choir functions as a living oscillator bank. Close-bright timbre at the core; wider plates only for climaxes.

### 13. Iron Choir at 180

Georgian Polyphony × Gabber

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Three-part Georgian male polyphony punctuating distorted 180 BPM kicks: pedal drones, cluster hits, alarm stabs; sparse breaks; short bunker IRs; non-lexical, martial-ritual energy.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A hard gabber frame (≈175–185 BPM) with distorted four-on-the-floor, offbeat claps, and siren stabs collides with rugged Georgian three-part harmony. Bass pedal drones underpin cluster shouts that act like brass stabs; mid sections thin to drone + tom-rolls before a slam return. Keep vocal material non-lexical (open “ah/oh”) for punch; use short bunker/warehouse IRs to keep clarity over the kick wall. Add rare Amen-slice fills to reset momentum. Granular tails only at cut-points—enough to seed ghost syllables without smearing transients. Ancient block chords meet rave steel.

### 14. Log-Drum Tenore (Coastal Glow)

Tenore (bassu/contra) × Amapiano

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Sardinian tenore (bassu/contra/mesu/oche) over warm amapiano: log-drum hooks, dusty keys, shaker roll; bassu mirrors log-drum; antiphonal cells, non-lexical; airy room, 113 BPM.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A gently rolling amapiano frame (~113 BPM) of log-drum bass hooks, mellow Rhodes, and shaker/hat ladders supports a Sardinian tenore circle. Bassu and contra provide a living sub that doubles the log-drum figure; mesu sustains mid drone; oche carries bright calls. Short antiphonal phrases are presented as rhythmic cells rather than lyrics, inviting soft ghost-syllables at phrase tails. Keep claps sparse, pads silky, and room IRs airy (small coastal hall) so the choir remains intimate. Occasional marimba or kalimba taps echo the log-drum shapes. Drops thin to Rhodes + bassu drone before the circle re-enters with an easy sway.

### 15. Soft-Foot Grime

Isicathamiya × Grime

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Isicathamiya male choir (soft-step stacks, bass hum) over 140 grime: jagged breaks, square-lead nicks, sliding sub; call-and-response refrains, non-lexical; short room, tape haze.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A 140 BPM grime chassis—syncopated kicks/snares, triplet hats, square-lead nicks, and a gliding sub—hosts isicathamiya’s soft-footed male choir. Close-voiced blocks and gentle bass hums become chorus stabs; brief call-and-response swells act as hooks without words. Keep vowels broad (“ah/oh/um”) for percussive clarity; bass hum rides the tonic like a pedal. Use short, tight rooms and mild tape flutter so consonants stay airy but present. Drops thin to sub + clap while the choir whispers a stacked unison, then the square-lead and triplet hats return for the slam. Entirely non-lexical; voice is rhythm and harmony.

### 16. Foundry Cantus (100)

Plainchant × Industrial

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Monophonic chant lines re-amped in metal spaces over slow industrial: piston rhythms, anvil hits, turbine drones; short bunker IRs, granular bloom; wordless melismas; ~100 BPM.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
A slow, machine-room ritual (~100 BPM): piston rhythms, heavy kick, anvil hits, and low turbine drones. A plainchant-style solo line (no sacred text) moves in free-time arcs above the grid, captured close, then re-amped through short bunker/ship-hull IRs for iron bloom. Granular tails and light wow/flutter seed ghost phonemes at phrase endings without smearing transients. Mid sections open into drone vaults where the chant threads alone before the cadence slams back. Keep the palette austere—metallic, oil-dark, reverberant but tight—so the vocal remains the torch in the factory haze.

A 160 BPM footwork lattice—rapid clap grids, micro-kicks, agile sub bursts—hosts a Qawwali-style layout. Lead voice rides a harmonium drone; a small chorus answers in short ecstatic cells. Those cells are sliced into grid-snapped vocal riffs (non-lexical taans and vowels) so the choir/lead become both melody and percussion. Tabla one-shots mark turnarounds; occasional handclap arcs cue rises and drops. Keep room IRs tight (small courtyard/stone) to preserve rapid articulation; add brief granular blooms at phrase ends to seed ghost syllables. Mid drop strips to harmonium + claps + lead melisma before the chorus re-enters, stacked and bright. Devotional energy, club agility—no quoted poetry.

### 18. Breath on the Floor (Gqom)

Inuit Katajjaq × Gqom

#### Style of Music (≤200 chars)
Percussive katajjaq duet (inhaled/exhaled bursts) over minimalist gqom: broken kick grid, cavern claps, gated sub; breath games become lead rhythm; tight warehouse IRs; non-lexical.

#### Style of Music (≤1000 chars)
Minimalist Durban gqom (~123–126 BPM): broken kick patterns, cavern claps, and gated sub air become the stage for an Inuit katajjaq duet. Short inhale/exhale motifs and percussive grunts are presented as antiphonal “breath riffs” that drive the groove—voice as drum. Occasional reverse grains and comb-filter sweeps at phrase ends seed phantom syllables without obscuring the percussive edge. Keep IRs tight (small warehouse/cinderblock) for punch; deploy air-horn/sweep FX sparingly. The first drop reduces to breath percussion + sub shadow, then the grid slams back with widened claps. Entirely non-lexical and body-forward.

## 4. Background music (BGM) base templates

### 1. Ambient / Drone (cinematic, evolving)

**Makeshift title:** Soft Engine, Far Horizon

#### Style of Music
- **v5.0 (long):** Evolving cinematic-ambient bed: airy analog pads and granular textures drift in slow harmonic arcs; distant bowed tones and soft sub bloom every 16–32 bars; no hook—just depth, warmth, and movement that stays under dialogue.
- **v4.x (short):** Evolving cinematic-ambient pads with subtle swells; warm, spacious underscore, no top-line.

#### Lyrics (meta-tags)
```
[instrumental]
[control: instrumental, no-repeat, dynamic transitions]
[genre: ambient, cinematic-underscore]
[style: minimal, evolving, wide, textural]
[mood: calm, warm, contemplative]
[instruments: analog-pads, granular-drones, bowed-textures, soft-sub, felt-piano-dust]
[signal-processing: reverb, delay, chorus, saturation]
[length: 300-360]
[sequence: intro, bed A, lift, bed B, coda]

[intro: soft fade-in; distant air; pad bloom from low mids]
[bed A: slow harmonic drift; no lead; occasional granular sparkle]
[lift: gentle density increase; bowed texture swells + soft-sub bloom]
[bed B: slightly brighter pad voicings; widen image; keep dynamics restrained]
[coda: long tail into near-silence; last pad held and thinned]
[end]
```

#### Producer.ai (Riffusion / FUZZ-2.0) — Sound prompt
A cinematic ambient bed of airy analog pads and granular drones; distant bowed textures, soft sub swells, felt-piano dust; evolving every 16–32 bars; no lead; dialog-friendly depth and warmth.  
**Riffusion meta-controls (optional):**  
- `influence_prompt: medium`  
- `influence_lyrics: low` (we’re using tags only as scaffolding)  
- `structure_hint: intro | bed A | lift | bed B | coda`

#### Canvas loop (Spotify)
- **Scene:** Slow aerial drift over a sunlit cloud sea.  
- **Action:** Pads “breathe” as cloud shadows glide beneath.  
- **FX:** Subtle parallax; faint grain; slow bloom pulses.  
- **Palette:** Pearl white, soft teal, pale amber.  
- **Style:** Minimal, meditative cinematography.  
- **Loop idea:** Start mid-drift → subtle zoom forward → crossfade back to starting frame.

#### First-frame still (cover art prompt)
Aerial, sunlit cloudscape from above; gentle haze; soft film grain; wide negative space for text; mood: calm, contemplative; colors: pearl white, soft teal, pale amber.

#### Bandcamp/Spotify blurb (poetic/meta)
A bed that breathes like a distant engine—no destination, only horizons. Pads rise and fall in slow cycles, leaving enough air for memory and voice to carry.

#### Why this fits (notes)
- Starts with `[instrumental]` and control tags upfront so v5 does not invent vocals; this has higher adherence in v4.5/v5 than earlier versions. 
- `[sequence]` placed right before sections to keep long-form cohesion and better Extend behavior. 
- Uses confirmed tags only; avoids weak/obsolete ones like `[loop]` or `[mix]`.

## 5. Veles Night templates (Slavic festival akin to Halloween)

Veles brings underworld, water/forest, cattle/wealth, shapeshifting serpent-bear-wolf vibes, plus patronage of music/poetry and a storm-myth rivalry with Perun. That points to earthy/low-register timbres, ritual pulse, drone, “white-voice” folk polyphony, and liminal field-recordings (water, marsh, wind in trees).

### 1. Ash of the Threshold

Ritual ambient × Slavic white-voice choir

#### Style of Music

Ritual-ambient with white-voice choir; low drones, frame-drum pulse, bell triads, cavern IR; wordless calls in open-throat style; dusk-to-dawn arc

#### Lyrics

```
[control: ritual-ambient, processional, cinematic-choral]
[genre: ritual-ambient, slavic-folk-choir]
[mood: chthonic, reverent, liminal, luminous-under-shadow]
[tempo: free to very-slow 48–60]
[length: 220]
[instruments: sub-drones, harmonium/pedal-tone, frame-drum(buben), bells, bowed-metals, gusli accents]
[vocals: white-voice polyphony, low-male drone, airy overtones]
[fx: cavern-reverb, subtle-thunder-IR, forest-wind]
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Low pedal drone, one bell in distance; breathy wind, faint bowed-metal bloom]
[verse: Solo white-voice phrase answered by low male drone; frame-drum heartbeats]
[pre-chorus: Drones widen; bells outline minor triad; air thickens]
[chorus: Full white-voice cluster swells; ritual pulse steady; luminous halo]
[verse: Return to narrower harmonies; gusli glints; drum thins]
[bridge: Bowed-metal surge + thunder IR; short silence pocket]
[chorus: Final choral lift; bells orbit slowly; equilibrium holds]
[outro: Pedal drone dissolves; last bell; wind fades]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

White-voice: the bright, open-throat Eastern European technique suits powerful wordless calls for ritual sections. 

Ritual ambient palette (drone, frame-drum pulse, cavernous space) aligns with documented ritual/dark-ambient practices in contemporary releases. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

“white-voice choir over sub-drones, frame-drum, cavern reverb, distant bells, very slow swell”

“bowed-metal bloom, thunder IR wash, breathy wind, ritual pulse returning”

“low male drone with bright open-throat calls, harmonium pedal, luminous halo”

### 2. Gravel Choir Descent

Dark folk × Drone doom (low-tuned acoustic + bowed metals)

#### Style of Music

Dark-folk lament fused with drone-doom weight; low-tuned acoustics, bowed-metals, cello drones, sparse toms; cavern reverb; solemn, glacial lift

#### Lyrics

```
[control: dark-folk, drone-doom, acoustic-heavy, cinematic-ambient]
[genre: dark-folk, drone-doom]
[mood: solemn, subterranean, elegiac]
[tempo: very-slow 4/4, sustained]
[length: 215]
[instruments: baritone-acoustic-guitar, nylon-guitar, cello/pedal-drones, bowed-metals, harmonium, floor-toms, bell-chimes, tape-hiss]
[vocals: low-male-chant, white-voice-pads, distant-harmonies (optional)]
[fx: cavern-reverb, analog-warmth, gentle-saturation]
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Tape hiss + low pedal drone; single bowed-metal bloom; bell far away]
[verse: Baritone acoustic plays slow dyads; cello sustains root; hush floor-toms]
[pre-chorus: Bowed-metals swell; harmonium breath opens air above the root]
[chorus: Drone deepens; white-voice pad thins then widens; subtle bell triad]
[verse: Guitar darkens; toms recede; cello doubles a 5th below]
[bridge: Held feedback-like overtone (bowed metal); tom triplets rise and fall]
[chorus: Final, heavier swell—drones thick; chant may enter as vowel tones]
[outro: Instruments release to pedal; last bell and hiss fade]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Drone doom traits—slow tempos, long-duration tones, minimal grooves, low-tuned weight—guide the pacing and drone layering. 

Dark/neo-folk angle adds acoustic intimacy (baritone/nylon guitars, chant/white-voice pads) and nature/ritual thematics. 

Bowed-metals are a standard dark-ambient/experimental technique for sustained, spectral overtones—perfect to “bridge” sections without drums. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

Sound prompt: “low-tuned acoustic drone with bowed-metal overtones, very slow toms, cavern reverb, tape hiss”

Sound prompt: “baritone acoustic dyads + cello pedal, harmonium breath, solemn bell triad, subterranean weight”

Sound prompt: “bridge swell—bowed cymbal feedback, tom triplets, sustained root drone, fading to hush”

### 3. Ashen Hex Processional

Neo-pagan folk × Witch-house

#### Style of Music

Neo-pagan-folk chant over witch-house half-time; chopped/pitched vox, gloomy pads, 808 throb; zhaleika/telynka wisps; heavy reverb & occult hush

#### Lyrics

```
[control: neo-pagan-folk, witch-house, half-time, ritual-club]
[genre: neo-pagan-folk, witch-house]
[mood: mystical, nocturnal, hypnotic]
[tempo: slow half-time 60–72]
[length: 205]
[instruments: 808-kick/sub, trap-hats, detuned-saw, haunted-pads, zhaleika/telynka, frame-drum (light), bass-chorus]
[vocals: chopped-and-screwed-vox, pitched-down whispers, white-voice call-responses]
[fx: heavy-reverb, long-delays, vinyl-crackle, occult-noise-beds]
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Haunted pad swells; slowed breath-vox texture; distant frame-drum]
[verse: Half-time 808 + hat ghosts; soft zhaleika/telynka phrases weave]
[pre-chorus: Vox chops stutter; noise bed opens; sub rises gently]
[chorus: Drag-weight drop—pitched-down chant, wide pad, sidechained throb]
[verse: Folk motif returns—wooden flute gliss + minimal 808]
[bridge: Deeper chop-and-screw; whispered counters; brief reverb-wash mute]
[chorus: Final hook—occult pads bloom; white-voice response sits behind lead]
[outro: Sub decays; pad trails; one whispered syllable lingers]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Witch-house DNA: chopped-and-screwed vocal processing, slowed half-time beats, dense reverb, occult/gothic aesthetics. 

Neo/“pagan folk” merges acoustic folk timbres with post-industrial/ambient atmospheres—here voiced as zhaleika/telynka lines and light frame-drum inside an electronic shell. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

Sound prompt: “witch-house half-time 808 with chopped/pitched vocals, haunted pads, occult reverb, slow drag”

Sound prompt: “folk hornpipe (zhaleika/telynka) over dark pads, minimal trap hats, ritual hush”

[bridge: Gudok overtone scrape; brief hush; pad modulates]
[chorus: Return of theme with thicker pad; soft choir-pad shadows]
[outro: Drone holds; bells and hiss fade]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Dungeon synth: ambient/keyboard-based, medieval/fantasy-evoking offshoot of early black-metal scenes—perfect for lo-fi, quest-like pads. 

Gusli (plucked Slavic zither) and gudok (reconstructed bowed folk fiddle with drone tuning) supply authentic East-Slavic color for the melodic/drone roles. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

“lo-fi cassette keys with medieval pad, gusli plucks, bell ostinato, stone room”

“gudok low drone with fifth, gusli motif, gentle frame-drum, misty ambience”

“bridge scrape and hush, pad modulation, return to theme with soft choir-pad”

### 5. Below the Willow Gate

Deep dark ambient × Hydrophone sound art

#### Style of Music

Sub-aqueous dark-ambient ritual; hydrophone textures, abyssal drones, bowed metals, willow-wind, distant bells; very slow, tidal swells; cavern IR; wordless choirs, nocturnal wildlife beds

#### Lyrics

```
[control: deep-dark-ambient, hydrophone-sound-art, processional]
[genre: dark-ambient, sound-art, ritual-ambient]
[mood: abyssal, liminal, reverent, aqueous]
[tempo: fluid-slow, meterless to 48–60 bpm swells]
[length: 240]
[instruments: hydrophone-beds, sub-drones, bowed-metals, low-cello/pedal-tone, bell-chimes, willow-shaker, zhaleika-distant, mossy-pads]
[vocals: wordless-choir-low, breath-accents, owl-calls]
[fx: cavern-reverb, thunder-IR, granular-water, forest-wind]
[sequence: intro, verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Hydrophone textures (bubbles, creaks, distant clicks) bloom under sub-drones; faint willow-wind and one bell chime]
[verse: Pedal-tone celli with bowed-metal swells; intermittent water-knocks; low wordless choir enters and recedes]
[chorus: Tidal swell—drones widen, soft bell triplet motif; shimmer of granular-water; calm, luminous undertone]
[verse: Return to darker strata—hydrophone crackle, distant zhaleika phrase like a serpent thread; owl far away]
[bridge: Storm-IR impulse; brief silence pocket; rising metallic overtones suggest sky-fire meeting root-water]
[chorus: Second swell—choir a shade brighter, bells orbit slowly; equilibrium holds, pressure settles]
[outro: Drones thin; hydrophone hush remains; wind through willow; last bell vanishes into Nav-like quiet]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Hydrophones convert underwater pressure changes/vibrations into audio signals—perfect for sub-aquatic beds that feel “underworld/water.” 

Practice context: Contemporary sound artists (e.g., Jana Winderen, Chris Watson) reveal hidden aquatic/ice acoustic ecologies—great reference points for textures (crackle, pops, creaks, clicks). 

Dark-ambient grammar: sustained drones, field recordings, low-register timbres, sparse but potent gestures—exactly what we’re doing here. 

Veles tie-ins: earth/waters/underworld + owl/serpent symbols; a luminous undertone in “chorus” sections underscores non-evil, balancing nature. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

Sound prompt: “sub-aquatic hydrophone bed, slow pressure swells, distant creaks and pops, abyssal drones, cavern reverb, singular bell”

Sound prompt: “bowed metal over dark drone, granular water textures, willow wind, very slow swells”

Sound prompt: “nocturnal wetland—owl far, soft mud knocks, hydrophone fizz, low choir pad, thunder IR bloom”

Sound prompt: “distant zhaleika thread above underwater crackle, pedal-tone drone, hush and return to depth”

Sound prompt: “equilibrium swell—brightened drone halo, faint bell triplets, water shimmer fading to silence”

#### Production cues (quick)

Tuning: low D or E; favor Dorian/Natural minor; add slight chorus to drones for “liquid” motion.

Dynamics: keep LUFS gentle (−20 to −18 short-term) so micro-details in hydrophone textures remain audible.

Space: one long cavern IR bus; parallel a very short early-reflection to keep creaks tactile.

Foley: if you lack real hydrophone beds, simulate with filtered pink noise + granular ice/water samples; sparsity > density.

### 5b. Ash-Bell Lament

Neofolk, complementary to 5.

#### Style of Music

Neofolk lament with hush-tempo guitar, cello drones, hand bells, soft white-voice layers, sparse percussion; pagan-nature mood; intimate yet somber

#### Lyrics

```
[control: neofolk, acoustic-lament, post-industrial-ambient]
[genre: neofolk, dark-folk, dark-ambient]
[mood: mournful, venerative, woodland]
[tempo: slow, sparse pulse]
[length: 200]
[instruments: nylon-guitar, baritone-guitar, cello/viola drones, gusli accents, hand-bells, light frame-drum, harmonium/pad]
[vocals: close-mic lead, white-voice layers, spoken-word option]
[fx: room-ambience, tape-hiss, leaf-rustle]
[sequence: intro, verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Tape-hiss bed; distant bell; soft guitar figure enters]
[verse: Lead vocal close and dry; cello drone underneath; minimal frame-drum]
[chorus: White-voice pad widens; bells mark cattle/wealth motif; harmonium breathes]
[verse: Gusli punctuates phrases; guitar darkens to minor/Dorian color]
[bridge: Spoken-word option over sustained strings; faint leaf-rustle]
[chorus: Wider neofolk stack—low male harmony added; bells orbit slow]
[outro: Guitar decays; single bell; room falls to hush]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Neofolk blends acoustic folk with dark-ambient/post-industrial atmospheres—ideal for solemn, mythic nature rites. 

Veles ties: cattle/wealth (bells), underworld/earth/water (low drones, mournful pace), woodland intimacy. 

Retaining white-voice color in a restrained layer keeps the Slavic timbre without overpowering the neofolk intimacy. 

Gusli gives authentic East-Slavic acoustic punctuation. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

“intimate neofolk guitar with cello drone, hand bells, room ambience, low tape hiss”

“white-voice pad behind close-mic vocal, slow pulse, harmonium breath”

“spoken-word bridge over sustained strings, leaf rustle, minor/Dorian hue”

### 6. Rootfire Procession

Ritual techno (slow) × Slavic frame-drum procession

Brings about rhythmic, mesmerising beds with hallucinated vocalisation; suitable for meditative/thrilling themes.

#### Style of Music

Slow ritual-techno × Slavic frame-drum rites; low drones, willow-dark strings, bone rattles; half-time toms, trance pulses, white-voice calls, river/wind beds; dusk-to-dawn arc; solemn yet luminous

#### Lyrics

```
[control: ritual-techno, processional, persona-agnostic, cinematic-ambient]
[genre: ritual-techno, slavic-folk-fusion, dark-ambient]
[mood: chthonic, reverent, ancestral, luminous-under-shadow]
[tempo: slow half-time pulse ~70–92, processional swing]
[length: 210]
[instruments: frame-drum(buben/tupan), low toms, gusli, bowed-metals, sub-drones, willow shaker, zhaleika/sopilka, mossy pads, bell-chimes]
[vocals: white-voice calls, low male drone, breathy chorus pads]
[fx: cavern-reverb, thunder-ir, hydrophone-water, forest-wind, distant-owl]
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: River-bed drones, willow-shaker rustle, distant frame-drum heartbeat; faint bell-chimes suggest cattle wealth]
[verse: Low toms + buben step; gusli ostinato enters; white-voice solo phrases (wordless) answer by soft male drone]
[pre-chorus: Sub-drones rise; bowed metal swells; toms double—anticipation before the solar lift]
[chorus: Procession opens—brighter pads, bell triads, wider white-voice harmonies; rhythm remains slow but radiant]
[verse: Motif returns earthward—tighter drums, quieter pads; zhaleika/sopilka serpentine line]
[bridge: Storm-myth chase—thunder IR hits, call-and-response between white-voice and tom triplets; brief silence breath]
[chorus: Final luminous pass—layered harmonies, gentle bell cycles; equilibrium of sky-fire and root-water]
[outro: Water/forest beds reclaim; frame-drum recedes; a last bell and owl call fade]
[end]
```

#### Why these choices (brief)

Veles’ attributes: underworld/lowlands, cattle/wealth, serpentine shapeshifter and rival to the sky-thunder Perun—yet not “evil,” more earth-water principle; hence low drones, bells (herds), water/forest beds, and a cyclical chase motif in the bridge. 

White-voice timbre evokes Slavic rites and open-air calling—perfect for wordless, powerful refrain layers without committing to lyrics yet. 

Frame drum (buben/tupan) procession anchors the ritual gait; adding bowed metals and sub drones keeps it subterranean. 

Slow ritual techno: we keep the hypnotic, steady pulse but in a 70–92 BPM half-time, processional zone—outside typical club BPM yet fully viable for “slow” DJ aesthetics. 

#### Production cues (quick)

Tonal center: low D/E, natural minor ↔ Dorian shifts for “ancient” color (brighten on choruses).

Drums: buben/tupan + low toms in duple half-time, with triplet flourishes in the bridge to suggest the Perun–Veles chase.

IRs/FX: layer a subtle thunder IR in the bridge and a hydrophone water bed under intros/outros to tie the underworld-waters theme. (Storm myth + water/lowlands domain.) 

#### Producer.ai prompts

Sound prompt: “slow ritual techno procession, frame drum and low toms, sub-bass drone, cavern reverb, forest wind and water textures, faint bell chimes”

Sound prompt: “white-voice solo phrases over gusli ostinato, mossy pads, half-time pulse, bowed metals rising”

Sound prompt: “bridge thunder ritual—tom triplets, bowed cymbals, storm impulse response, short silence break, return to drone”

Sound prompt: “serpentine zhaleika over dark ambient drones, half-time ritual techno kick-toms, hydrophone water bed”

Sound prompt: “final luminous chorus—wider harmonies, soft bells, steady processional drums, trance-calm pads”

### 7. Mosslight Dreaming

Psybient × Forest folk (telynka/sopilka over pads)

#### Style of Music

Psybient forest drift; warm pads, slow sub-pulse, telynka/sopilka leads, bird/leaf beds, soft hand-percussion; hypnotic, meditative, woodland

#### Lyrics

```
[control: psybient, forest-folk, cinematic-ambient]
[genre: psybient, downtempo-ambient]
[mood: numinous, tranquil, woodland]
[tempo: slow 70–90 or meterless swells]
[length: 205]
[instruments: telynka(overtone-flute), sopilka(folk-flute), warm-pads, soft-sub, hand-percussion, wind-chimes]
[vocals: airy-hums, breathy-oo, distant-choral-pad (optional)]
[fx: leaf-rustle, birds, small-stream, long-delays]
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Leaf and stream bed; soft pad drone; faint chimes]
[verse: Telynka overtone phrases weave; sopilka echoes; soft-sub heartbeat]
[pre-chorus: Pads thicken; delay tails bloom; hand-percussion ghosts enter]
[chorus: Wide pad lift; overtone flute sings simple motif; slow trance calm]
[verse: Motif variation; birds lighten; sub and pads breathe]
[bridge: Airy-vox pad swells; brief hush; chime cascade returns]
[chorus: Final halo—telynka+sopilka in call-and-response over pads]
[outro: Pads thin; stream and leaves close the scene]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Psybient/psychill = ambient + psytrance aesthetics at slower, meditative tempos—ideal for “forest drift” pads and sub-pulse. 

Telynka (telenka/telynka) is an overtone flute without finger holes; sopilka is a Slavic end-blown folk flute—perfect organic leads over pads.

### 8. Grief Under Bark

Neofolk × Funeral doom strings

#### Style of Music

Neofolk lament with funeral-doom strings; close acoustic guitar, low cello/viola drones, bells; sul-pont tremor swells; very slow, processional

#### Lyrics

```
[control: neofolk, funeral-doom-strings, acoustic-lament]
[genre: neofolk, funeral-doom]
[mood: mournful, reverent, cavernous]
[tempo: very-slow 40–60, processional]
[length: 215]
[instruments: nylon-guitar, baritone-guitar, cello/viola drones, contrabass, harmonium, hand-bells, floor-toms (sparse)]
[vocals: low-male or close-mic lead, white-voice-pad (very soft, optional)]

[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Tape hiss + hand-bell; contrabass breathes a long pedal]
[verse: Close guitar figure; cello drone and faint harmonium]
[pre-chorus: Strings lean sul ponticello; tension rises without tempo lift]
[chorus: Funeral swell—low strings + baritone guitar dyads; bell orb]
[verse: Return to dry room; whispered harmony shade]
[bridge: Section tremolo sul pont—eerie glassy overtones; toms pulse once]
[chorus: Heaviest swell; drones deepen; voice can sustain vowel tones]
[outro: Pedal fades; last bell; room falls quiet]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Neofolk blends acoustic folk with dark-ambient/post-industrial aesthetics—fits the intimate, pagan-nature lament. 

Funeral doom emphasizes extremely slow tempos and massive, processional weight—here rendered via low strings and sparse toms. 

Sul ponticello bowing yields the eerie, glassy overtones used in the pre-chorus/bridge swells.

### 9. Predator Step

Gqom-tempo ritual × Bear/wolf drums

#### Style of Music

Dark gqom-tempo ritual; sparse heavy kicks, low tom ensembles (“bear/wolf” power), frame-drum hits, breathy hisses; hypnotic, minimal; nocturnal procession

#### Lyrics

```
[control: ritual-club, minimal-percussion, cinematic-dark]
[genre: gqom, ritual-ambient, tribal-Drums]
[mood: predatory, hypnotic, chthonic]
[tempo: 126–130 gqom-tempo, halftime feels allowed]
[length: 205]
[instruments: 808-kick(sub), low-toms(ensemble), frame-drum(buben/tupan), shaker-rattle, detuned-saw-stabs, bass-drones, breath-noise]
[vocals: percussive-grunts, short calls, crowd-shouts (optional)]
[fx: long-reverb, room-slap, sub-drop, reverse-suck]
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Sub-drones and distant tom calls; one frame-drum hit sets the gait]
[verse: Broken kick pattern + tom accents; breath hisses syncopate the gaps]
[pre-chorus: Bass swell; short reverse-suck; tom rolls hint at drop]
[chorus: Full stomp—heavy kick, tom ensemble in unison; ritual claps layer]
[verse: Motif mutates; fewer kicks, more tom triplets; shaker-rattle enters]
[bridge: Call-and-response toms; brief silence pocket, then sub-drop]
[chorus: Final stomp—wide stereo toms; crowd shouts tucked back]
[outro: Kicks mute; tom echoes decay; last frame-drum hit fades]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Gqom’s hallmark is minimal, raw, repetitive beat design with heavy bass and non-four-on-the-floor patterns—perfect for a predatory, ritual stomp. 

Typical working tempo zone: ~126–130 BPM (can be felt in halftime at ~63–65), matching the above pacing. 

“Bear/wolf drums” is realized via low tom ensembles and frame-drum colors (buben/tupan) to keep it culturally generic yet authentic to regional hand-drum timbres. 

Dark, hypnotic atmosphere aligns with widely noted gqom aesthetics. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

“gqom minimal stomp, heavy sub kick, low tom ensemble, ritual claps, dark room”

“frame-drum hits with broken kick, breathy hisses, reverse-suck riser”

“bridge call-and-response toms, silence pocket, deep sub-drop return”

[instruments: organ/pedal-drone, soft-strings, bell(single), glass-harmonics (subtle)]
[vocals: white-voice-solo (open-throat), faint octave-doubling (optional)]
[fx: long-cavern-IR, natural-room, gentle-tape-hiss]
[sequence: intro, verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Pedal drone establishes tonic; one bell strikes; silence breath]
[verse: White-voice solo enters—stepwise, chant-like; organ sustains triad tones]
[chorus: Tintinnabuli-style triad arpeggios halo the solo; dynamic barely rises]
[verse: Return to near-silence; solo on a lower reciting tone; organ thins]
[bridge: Short bell + sustained harmonic; two bars of deep quiet]
[chorus: Final statement—solo above simple triad; time feels suspended]
[outro: Drone closes; last partial of bell hangs and fades]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Sacred minimalism / tintinnabuli: chant-influenced, ultra-reduced materials, triad-based haloing, silence and simplicity central to affect. 

White-voice (open-throat, bright carry) suits unaccompanied/near-unaccompanied, chant-like solo over drones. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

“white-voice solo over quiet organ drone, single bell strike, long cavern reverb”

“tintinnabuli-like triad halo, very slow breath pacing, near-silence passages”

“final cadence: sustained drone, fading bell partials, contemplative air”

### 11. Lanterns Under Rain

Trip-hop × Zhaleika/gusli

#### Style of Music

Moody trip-hop with Slavic folk leads; smoked-vinyl drums, dubby bass, rainy keys; zhaleika hornpipe motifs and gusli plucks over atmospheric pads; late-night, cinematic

#### Lyrics

```
[control: trip-hop, folk-fusion, cinematic-noir]
[genre: trip-hop, downtempo, slavic-folk]
[mood: nocturnal, melancholic, intimate]
[tempo: slow 70–84, swung breakbeat]
[length: 210]
[instruments: dusty-breaks, sub-bass, rhodes/lofi-keys, pads, zhaleika, gusli, vinyl-crackle]
[vocals: hushed lead or spoken-word, ghost harmonies (optional)]
[fx: tape-hiss, spring-reverb, dub-delays]
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Vinyl crackle; soft pad; sparse rhodes; distant zhaleika call]
[verse: Swung dusty break + sub-bass; gusli arpeggio sketches motif]
[pre-chorus: Delay throws widen; hornpipe echoes answer keys]
[chorus: Full trip-hop bloom—fat sub, wide pads; zhaleika sings hook]
[verse: Beat thins; spoken-word/hushed lead rides the groove]
[bridge: Dub space—drums drop to rim/ghosts; gusli harmonics shimmer]
[chorus: Return bigger—hornpipe + keys in unison; bass deeper]
[outro: Break dissolves; last zhaleika note and tape-hiss fade]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Trip-hop: slow, atmospheric, Bristol-scene breakbeats + dub/jazz/soul influences—fits the smoky, late-night pacing here. 

Zhaleika: single-reed Slavic “folk clarinet”/hornpipe with piercing, plaintive timbre—perfect for the vocal-like lead lines. 

Gusli: East-Slavic plucked zither; historic folk color that complements the hornpipe with soft arpeggios. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

“slow trip-hop break with sub-bass, rainy rhodes, vinyl crackle, dub delay”

“zhaleika hornpipe lead over atmospheric pads, echo throws, film-noir mood”

“gusli plucks weaving through swung breakbeat, spring reverb, night city air”

### 12. Iron & Hallelujah

Post-industrial ritual × Field hymns

#### Style of Music

Ritual post-industrial—chains, logs, metal scrapes, low drum processions—crossed with field-recorded hymn fragments (shape-note/Sacred-Harp flavor), framed as distant, communal calls in a hollow-square-like space

#### Lyrics

```
[control: post-industrial, ritual-ambient, field-hymns]
[genre: post-industrial, ritual-ambient, folk-hymn]
[mood: solemn, numinous, cathartic]
[tempo: slow 60–72, processional]
[length: 220]
[instruments: log-drums, chain-scrapes, metal-sheets bowed, floor-toms, harmonium/pedal, bell, tape-machine]
[vocals: field-hymn snippets (a cappella stack), leader calls + group responses]
[fx: stone-room-IR, tape-wobble, outdoor-air, distant-crowd]
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, outro]

[intro: Outdoor air + faint congregation murmur; single bell; far hymn fragment]
[verse: Log-drum pulse; chain scrape rhythm; leader call (distant, dry)]
[pre-chorus: Harmonium pedal swells; metal sheet bowed; room size grows]
[chorus: Field-hymn stack enters (short, loud, participatory), framed by toms]
[verse: Hymn recedes; ritual hits in asymmetrical pattern; tape wobble]
[bridge: Silence pocket; bell and breath; brief unison shout; thunder of metal]
[chorus: Final communal swell—hymn fragment returns; drums heavier]
[outro: Air returns; congregation fades; one last chain rattle and bell]
[end]
```

#### Why these materials

Post-industrial is a catch-all for industrial-derived, non-dance strains (ritual/dark ambient, death industrial, neofolk, etc.)—the metal/wood/ritual palette is idiomatic here. 

Field hymns: shape-note/Sacred Harp is participatory, loud, communal (hollow-square) a cappella—perfect for “leader + group” calls as environmental layers. 

Field recording practice justifies treating the hymn layers and outdoor ambience as location sound, not studio choir. 

#### Producer.ai prompts

“ritual metal and log-drum procession, chain scrapes, stone room, single bell”

“distant Sacred-Harp-style a cappella stack in hollow-square feel, leader calls”

“silence pocket then metal thunder, tape wobble, outdoor air returning”

# Appendix A2. Extend-Safe Structure Cheat-Sheet (long ambiences, v5)

**Goals:** predictable 4–7 min arcs; safe variation without “new song” pivots; dialog-friendly dynamics.

### 1) “Breathing Bed” (gentle rise/fall)
```
[length: 300-420]
[sequence: intro, bed A, lift, bed B, coda]

[intro: soft fade; low-mid pads only]
[bed A: slow harmonic drift; no lead]
[lift: +10–15% density; add one new layer (bowed texture / light percussion bloom)]
[bed B: maintain lift elements; slightly brighter voicings or widened image]
[coda: subtractive fade; leave tail + noise/air]
[end]
```
**Why it extends well:** one additive “lift” only; B mirrors A with tiny timbre shift; safe for repeated Extend without motif creep.

### 2) “A/B Textures” (color change, same harmony)
```
[length: 300-390]
[sequence: intro, bed A, bed B, bed A2, outro]

[intro: filtered source; establish space]
[bed A: primary texture set]
[bed B: swap pad engine (chorus vs granular), keep harmony + rhythm identical]
[bed A2: return to A with micro-variation (extra shimmer / gentle sub bloom)]
[outro: long tail; no new content]
[end]
```
**Why it extends well:** alternation provides variety without new themes; A2 signals “return,” aiding coherence.

### 3) “Bed + Break” (brief negative space)
```
[length: 300-360]
[sequence: intro, bed, break, lift, bed, coda]

[break: drums thin OR pads filter down; keep low noise-floor so it doesn’t feel like a cut]
[lift: re-introduce elements with +1 layer only]
```
**Why it extends well:** the break resets ear fatigue; the single-step lift avoids runaway climaxes on repeated Extend.

### General do/don’t for Extend
- **Do:** one new element per lift, small imaging changes (wider/narrower), filter moves, velocity softening.  
- **Don’t:** introduce strong leads, hard hits, or new chord vocab after the first minute.  
- **Keep:** `[control: dynamic transitions]`, and finish each section with a tail so Extend seams hide in reverb.

# Appendix B. Producer.ai (Riffusion FUZZ-2.0) Side-by-Side Workflow

### When to prefer **Suno v5.0**
- You need **strict instrumental control** (no surprise vocals).  
- You rely on **[sequence]** semantics and long-form cohesion.  
- Persona/cover workflows (Producer.ai lacks Persona; Suno wins for persona-amplified styles).

**Suno quick spec**
- Start with `[instrumental]`, place controls first.  
- `[sequence]` immediately before sections; keep one additive “lift.”  
- Avoid unsupported/noisy tags (no `[bpm]`, no `[language]`).

### When to prefer **Producer.ai (FUZZ-2.0 / Raw)**
- You want **fast textural variation** from the same prompt.  
- You need **phrasal groove** beds (lo-fi, house, dnb) with quick A/B alternates.  
- You’re doing **dual-service fishing** (generate in both and pick the cleaner bed).

**Producer.ai baseline settings (beds)**
- **Sound prompt:** (use the same “long” Style-of-Music line you give Suno; explicitly say “no lead / dialog-friendly”).  
- **Meta-controls (if available):**  
  - `influence_prompt: medium–high`  
  - `influence_lyrics/tags: low` (or omit)  
  - `structure_hint:` mirror your Suno sequence names (`intro | bed A | lift | bed B | coda`)  
  - `duration:` 180–360 s  
  - `seed:` set if you’ll version-hunt

### Re-render / pick criteria (A/B selection)
1) **Noise floor & transients**  
   - Reject if hiss/crackle overtakes quiet passages (unless intended lo-fi).  
   - Prefer soft transients (no sudden spikes that fight VO).

2) **Midrange congestion (1–3 kHz)**  
   - Prefer mixes that leave space for voice; avoid pokey leads or harsh pads.

3) **Section clarity**  
   - You should “hear” the sequence markers (A → lift → B) without new themes appearing.

4) **Loop/Extend seams**  
   - Prefer versions with long tails and steady ambiences; seams should hide naturally.

5) **Persona/brand fit**  
   - If bed carries subtle vocal-like formants, choose Suno for tighter suppression; otherwise Producer.ai can bring nice grit.

### Dual-service recipe (practical)
- **Step 1:** Draft once (Suno tags + long Style text).  
- **Step 2:** Render in **Suno v5.0** + **Producer.ai FUZZ-2.0**.  
- **Step 3:** Rate 1–5 on: *VO space, dynamics smoothness, section clarity, ear-fatigue (5-min listen).*  
- **Step 4:** If neither passes, **reduce elements** (drop a layer, lower “lift” intensity) and re-render both with the same seed (Producer.ai) or same tags (Suno).  
- **Step 5:** Archive winner + exact text/controls for reproducibility.
