## 1. Recommended track definition template

The below is track definition template to use in general, unless the user doesn't define or request different structure.

Note: [length: 180] is a generic length (3 minutes), suitable for most situations with v3.5 and v4.0.

[length: 360] is a good standard for v4.5 large-scale pieces, uch as ambient instrumentals.

For actual songs the length should be set to lesser values to avoid provoking engine to duplicate verses.

#### Style of Music

As required by definition, length:

- no more than 200 characters long for models v4.0 and earlier
- no more than 1000 characters long for models v4.5 and above

provide both unless requested otherwise.

- **v4.x (short):** Evolving cinematic-ambient pads with subtle swells; warm, spacious underscore, no top-line.

#### Lyrics (meta-tags)
```
[instrumental]
[control: instrumental, no-repeat, dynamic transitions]
[genre: ambient, cinematic-underscore]
[style: minimal, evolving, wide, textural]

[bed B: slightly brighter pad voicings; widen image; keep dynamics restrained]
[coda: long tail into near-silence; last pad held and thinned]
[end]
```

#### Producer.ai (Riffusion / FUZZ-2.0) — Sound prompt
A cinematic ambient bed of airy analog pads and granular drones; distant bowed textures, soft sub swells, felt-piano dust; evolving every 16–32 bars; no lead; dialog-friendly depth and warmth.  
**Riffusion meta-controls (optional):**  
- `influence_prompt: medium`  
- `influence_lyrics: low` (we’re using tags only as scaffolding)  
- `structure_hint: intro | bed A | lift | bed B | coda`

#### Canvas loop (Spotify)
- **Scene:** Slow aerial drift over a sunlit cloud sea.  
- **Action:** Pads “breathe” as cloud shadows glide beneath.  
- **FX:** Subtle parallax; faint grain; slow bloom pulses.  
- **Palette:** Pearl white, soft teal, pale amber.  
- **Style:** Minimal, meditative cinematography.  
- **Loop idea:** Start mid-drift → subtle zoom forward → crossfade back to starting frame.

#### First-frame still (cover art prompt)
Aerial, sunlit cloudscape from above; gentle haze; soft film grain; wide negative space for text; mood: calm, contemplative; colors: pearl white, soft teal, pale amber.

#### Bandcamp/Spotify blurb (poetic/meta)
A bed that breathes like a distant engine—no destination, only horizons. Pads rise and fall in slow cycles, leaving enough air for memory and voice to carry.

#### Why this fits (notes)
- Starts with `[instrumental]` and control tags upfront so v5 does not invent vocals; this has higher adherence in v4.5/v5 than earlier versions. fileciteturn2file13L5-L11  
- `[sequence]` placed right before sections to keep long-form cohesion and better Extend behavior. fileciteturn2file12L38-L41  
- Uses confirmed tags only; avoids weak/obsolete ones like `[loop]` or `[mix]`. fileciteturn2file12L1-L14

### 3. Piano Underscore (neo-classical / felt piano)

**Makeshift title:** Quiet Room, Open Window

#### Style of Music
- **v5.0 (long):** Intimate felt-piano underscore with soft attack and legato phrasing; slow, breath-like dynamics and gentle pedal ambience; small, repeating motifs that evolve subtly every 16–32 bars; wide room reverb; no melody spotlight—supportive, narrative, voiceover-friendly.

# Appendix A2. Extend-Safe Structure Cheat-Sheet (long ambiences, v5)

**Goals:** predictable 4–7 min arcs; safe variation without “new song” pivots; dialog-friendly dynamics.

### 1) “Breathing Bed” (gentle rise/fall)
```
[length: 300-420]
[sequence: intro, bed A, lift, bed B, coda]

[intro: soft fade; low-mid pads only]
[bed A: slow harmonic drift; no lead]
[lift: +10–15% density; add one new layer (bowed texture / light percussion bloom)]
[bed B: maintain lift elements; slightly brighter voicings or widened image]
[coda: subtractive fade; leave tail + noise/air]
[end]
```
**Why it extends well:** one additive “lift” only; B mirrors A with tiny timbre shift; safe for repeated Extend without motif creep.

### 2) “A/B Textures” (color change, same harmony)
```
[length: 300-390]
[sequence: intro, bed A, bed B, bed A2, outro]

[intro: filtered source; establish space]
[bed A: primary texture set]
[bed B: swap pad engine (chorus vs granular), keep harmony + rhythm identical]
[bed A2: return to A with micro-variation (extra shimmer / gentle sub bloom)]
[outro: long tail; no new content]
[end]
```
**Why it extends well:** alternation provides variety without new themes; A2 signals “return,” aiding coherence.

### 3) “Bed + Break” (brief negative space)
```
[length: 300-360]
[sequence: intro, bed, break, lift, bed, coda]

[break: drums thin OR pads filter down; keep low noise-floor so it doesn’t feel like a cut]
[lift: re-introduce elements with +1 layer only]
```
**Why it extends well:** the break resets ear fatigue; the single-step lift avoids runaway climaxes on repeated Extend.

### General do/don’t for Extend
- **Do:** one new element per lift, small imaging changes (wider/narrower), filter moves, velocity softening.  
- **Don’t:** introduce strong leads, hard hits, or new chord vocab after the first minute.  
- **Keep:** `[control: dynamic transitions]`, and finish each section with a tail so Extend seams hide in reverb.

# Appendix B. Producer.ai (Riffusion FUZZ-2.0) Side-by-Side Workflow

### When to prefer **Suno v5.0**
- You need **strict instrumental control** (no surprise vocals).  
- You rely on **[sequence]** semantics and long-form cohesion.  
- Persona/cover workflows (Producer.ai lacks Persona; Suno wins for persona-amplified styles).

**Suno quick spec**
- Start with `[instrumental]`, place controls first.  
- `[sequence]` immediately before sections; keep one additive “lift.”  
- Avoid unsupported/noisy tags (no `[bpm]`, no `[language]`).

### When to prefer **Producer.ai (FUZZ-2.0 / Raw)**
- You want **fast textural variation** from the same prompt.  
- You need **phrasal groove** beds (lo-fi, house, dnb) with quick A/B alternates.  
- You’re doing **dual-service fishing** (generate in both and pick the cleaner bed).

**Producer.ai baseline settings (beds)**
- **Sound prompt:** (use the same “long” Style-of-Music line you give Suno; explicitly say “no lead / dialog-friendly”).  
- **Meta-controls (if available):**  
  - `influence_prompt: medium–high`  
  - `influence_lyrics/tags: low` (or omit)  
  - `structure_hint:` mirror your Suno sequence names (`intro | bed A | lift | bed B | coda`)  
  - `duration:` 180–360 s  
  - `seed:` set if you’ll version-hunt

### Re-render / pick criteria (A/B selection)
1) **Noise floor & transients**  
   - Reject if hiss/crackle overtakes quiet passages (unless intended lo-fi).  
   - Prefer soft transients (no sudden spikes that fight VO).

2) **Midrange congestion (1–3 kHz)**  
   - Prefer mixes that leave space for voice; avoid pokey leads or harsh pads.

3) **Section clarity**  
   - You should “hear” the sequence markers (A → lift → B) without new themes appearing.

4) **Loop/Extend seams**  
   - Prefer versions with long tails and steady ambiences; seams should hide naturally.

5) **Persona/brand fit**  
   - If bed carries subtle vocal-like formants, choose Suno for tighter suppression; otherwise Producer.ai can bring nice grit.

### Dual-service recipe (practical)
- **Step 1:** Draft once (Suno tags + long Style text).  
- **Step 2:** Render in **Suno v5.0** + **Producer.ai FUZZ-2.0**.  
- **Step 3:** Rate 1–5 on: *VO space, dynamics smoothness, section clarity, ear-fatigue (5-min listen).*  
- **Step 4:** If neither passes, **reduce elements** (drop a layer, lower “lift” intensity) and re-render both with the same seed (Producer.ai) or same tags (Suno).  
- **Step 5:** Archive winner + exact text/controls for reproducibility.
